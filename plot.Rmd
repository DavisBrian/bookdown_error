Short little intro chapter

## Plotting causes error

Trying to "Build Book"" with this plot causes an error.  Removing the plot book builds fine.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```


However, if you "Knit" it will build just fine.
